# Question

Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer

JSON is Javscript Object Notation and it is used to save the data type inside of objects for record-keeping or data transfer. The example below is not valid JSON because JSON is valid when the key and value pairs are strings. This can be done by using JSON.stringify() which will return the proper JSON format with quotation marks on of the converted key and value pairs into strings.
