# Question

What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer

Pass by reference is when the variable refers to a specific dataset in memory. Pass by value is when the raw values are copied. The one that is mutable is the pass by reference as any changes made to the reference will be permanent.
